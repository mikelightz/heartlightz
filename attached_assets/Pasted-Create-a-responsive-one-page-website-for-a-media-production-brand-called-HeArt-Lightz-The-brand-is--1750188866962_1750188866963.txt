Create a responsive one-page website for a media production brand called HeArt Lightz. The brand is bold, artistic, heart-centered, and mission-driven. The visual aesthetic should be sleek and minimal with warmth — use a palette of deep red (#8B1E3F), soft cream (#F9F4EF), and cool grey (#4A4A4A). Add subtle motion or hover effects that feel fluid and creative (like soft fades, underline glows, or slow reveals).

    ◦    Bold logo or wordmark
    ◦    Tagline: “Media for dreamers. Stories for a new way of living.”
